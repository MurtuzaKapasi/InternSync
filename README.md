# Techstars_INTERNSYNC

## This project simplifies hiring with a web-app. Job seekers create profiles and upload resumes, while recruiters post jobs and filter candidates. Using a DistilBERT ML model from Hugging Face, the app matches candidates with job listings, enhancing the experience for all.

# Features:
* User Authentication: Job seekers and recruiters can register and log in to their respective accounts.
* Job Seeker Profile Creation: Job seekers can upload their resumes, and the application automatically extracts relevant information to create detailed profiles.
* Recruiter Job Posting: Recruiters can create job postings with eligibility criteria, job descriptions, required skills, responsibilities, and salary information.

* Automatic Resume Parsing: The application parses uploaded resumes to extract personal information, education, work experience, skills, certifications, test scores, etc.
* Machine Learning Matching: The DistilBERT model processes job descriptions and candidate profiles, providing a matching percentage to recruiters.
* Feedback Mechanism: Job seekers receive feedback on their application status, missing skills, in-demand skills, salary statistics, and reasons for not being shortlisted.
* Secure Data Handling: The application ensures the secure storage and handling of sensitive data, adhering to best practices for data privacy and security.

## Technology Stack
* Frontend: React.js, Gradio for model integration
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js
* Database: MongoDB
* Machine Learning Model: DistilBERT (Hugging Face)
* Deployment: Heroku for backend, Netlify for frontend

## Usage
* Open the application in your browser.
* Register as a job seeker or recruiter.
* Upload your resume (job seeker) or create a job posting (recruiter).
* The machine learning model will process the data and provide matching percentages.
* Receive feedback and improve your profile/application based on suggestions.

## Roadmap
- Implement additional features such as chat support for communication between job seekers and recruiters.
- Enhance the machine learning model to provide more accurate matching and feedback.
- Expand platform functionality to support internships, freelance projects, and remote work opportunities
